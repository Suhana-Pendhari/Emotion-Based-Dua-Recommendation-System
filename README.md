## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam (for real-time detection)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

**Option A: Using pip (Recommended)**
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option B: If you encounter Windows Long Path issues**
1. Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```
2. Restart your computer
3. Then run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Step 2: Train the Model (First Time Only)

The model needs to be trained before use. Navigate to the EmotionRecognition directory:

```powershell
cd EmotionRecognition
python model\train_model.py
```

This will:
- Load the training dataset from `EmotionRecognition/dataset/train/`
- Train a CNN model for emotion recognition
- Save the model as `EmotionRecognition/model/emotion_model.h5`

**Note:** Training may take 10-30 minutes depending on your hardware.
